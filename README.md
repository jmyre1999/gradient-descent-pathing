# Gradient Descent Pathing Algorithm Demo
### Implementation done in Python 3.8.7

This program is a demonstration of the gradient descent algorithm for pathing around obstacles in a 3D environment. It uses VPython to display 3D graphics and NumPy for matrix calculations. 

#### To run from directory
1. Install requirements with "pip install -r requirements.txt"
2. Run "python animation.py"
